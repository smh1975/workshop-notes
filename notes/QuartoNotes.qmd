## Load Data

```{r}
#| label: setup
#| include: false

library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)
library(knitr)
```

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| code-fold: true
#| label: fig-box
#| fig-cap: "Boxplot of penguin body mass by sex"
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = sex, y = body_mass_g)) + geom_boxplot()
```

As you can see in @fig-box, males are larger than females.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-sample
#| tbl-cap: "Sample sizes of penguins by size and island"
table(penguins$sex, penguins$island, useNA = "always") |> kable()
```

You can also see this in @tbl-sample

## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
